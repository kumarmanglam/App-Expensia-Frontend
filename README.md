# Expense Application Frontend

## Overview

The software helps in managing and tracking expenses, income and invesments. Provides users with a user-friendly interface for efficient financial management so that they come back to this application.

## How it Works:

- Component Structure: Components are organized based on their functionality (e.g., Common, Dashboard, Auth) for a modular and maintainable codebase.

- Redux State Management: Redux is used for managing the application's state. Actions trigger changes, and reducers specify how the state changes.

- Styling: Tailwind CSS is employed for styling to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design. Additional custom styles can be added in custom.css.

- Entry Points: App.js serves as the main component structure, and index.js is the entry point that renders the React app into the HTML.

This structure promotes code organization, reusability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale the application. Components can be easily extended or modified, and state management is centralized with Redux.
